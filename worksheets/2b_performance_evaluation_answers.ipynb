    "The ROC curve gives a better view of the compromise between the two error types. This graph shows the relationship between the *false positive rate* and *true positive rate*. Each point on the curve represents a different classifier. In our case we can vary the value of k, recording the FPR and TPR at each point. Randomly guessing will give us a straight line in ROC space, and we seek to do better by being above and left (higher TPR for a given FPR; lower FPR for a given TPR).
